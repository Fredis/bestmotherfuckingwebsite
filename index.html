			<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px; padding-bottom:0px;">This is the <span class="still">best</span> motherfucking website. </h1>
			<p style="margin-top:10px;">Really, it is.</p>
			
			<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
			<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB: <span class="motherfuckingwebsites">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
			<p><span style="color: #C31B1B; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>
			
			<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
			<p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="motherfuckingwebsites">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
				<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google home page</a></li>
				<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
				<li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
				<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span class="miniText">well, kind of</span></li>
				<li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span class="miniText">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span></li>
				<li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
				<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
				<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <span class="miniText">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</span></li>
				<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
				<li>Doesn't include any tracking service <span class="miniText">this website does, but hey, who cares</span></li>
				<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
				<li>Use some fucking <span class="animationColor">colors.</span></li>
				<li>Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
			<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>

			<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
			<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <span class="police">line-height: 1.4</span> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
			<p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

			<h2>A little less contrast</h2>
			<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice  <span class="police">#EEEEEE</span> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

			<h2>Size Matters</h2>
			<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>

			<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
			<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

			<h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
			<p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
